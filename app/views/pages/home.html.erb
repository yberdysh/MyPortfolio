      <p>
    I learned how to code partially on my own, and partially through a comprehensive program at  <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/montreal">Le Wagon Montreal</a>. This is a 9 week accelerated program that taught me the skills I need for fullstack web development using technologies such as Ruby on Rails, Javascript, HTML, and more. I am currently looking for employment in Montreal and accepting freelance work. Check out some of the projects I've coded at Le Wagon below. Outside of computer languages, I enjoy speaking and learning human languages such as Mandarin, Russian, French, and more. I also have a handsome husband, dog, and cat (of course). I'd love to get to know you over a cup of tea, so please don't hesitate to reach out.

        <p>My team and I were given a challenge to create a web product in the last ten days of our
  program. Globegetter is a web platform for travel enthusiasts where users are able to set
  long-term travel goals in order to fulfill them over many years. A user can specify how
  many places they would like to visit, add desired travel destinations to their vision,
  mark off where they have been, see the progress of their goal, as well as see pertinent
  information about a specific place.</p>

        <h4> <a href="https://alexolthofftaskit.herokuapp.com">TaskIt!</a> </h4>
        <p>I worked in a team of three to take on the challenge of coding a marketplace website in only
  five days. The innovative product that my team and I created is a platform for both employers
  looking to hire and students looking to apply for internships. With TaskIt, employers of
  startups and small companies can post their company's internship in order to hire someone
  on a short-term basis of just a few weeks. Students who crave experience in a new field
  can create a profile similar to LinkedIn, browse internships, and apply easily by sending
  their application straight to the employer's inbox.</p>

        <h4> <a href="https://mr-cocktail-yberdysh.herokuapp.com">Mr. Cocktail</a> </h4>
        <p>Mr. Cocktail is a web application that I created when I first started working with rails.
  This app provides an online platform for users to come together and share cocktail recipes.
  A user is able to browse and read different cocktail recipes, as well as upload their own!
  Everyone was very grateful for this app after a long week of coding.</p>

        <h4> <a href="https://vegan-montreal.herokuapp.com">Vegan Montreal</a> </h4>
        <p>This is one of the first full-functioning projects that I built and was able to deploy.
  When I moved to Montreal, I noticed that there were a lot of vegan restuarants, so I wanted
  to create a one-stop website that would show all of them with ratings. Vegan Montreal is
  similar to Yelp in that it is a community driven platform where users are able to rate
  and review vegan restaurants in Montreal.</p>
